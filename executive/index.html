<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Dewdrop is a work-in-progress reimplementation of Sun's
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">
    NeWS
  </a> (Network/extensible Window System) version 1.1,
  by <a href="http://rsnous.com">Omar Rizwan</a>.
  Its PostScript interpreter and standard library are based on
  Tom Hlavaty's <a href="http://logand.com/sw/wps/">WPS</a>.
  It's licensed under the GPLv3.
  <a href="https://github.com/osnr/dewdrop">Source is on GitHub.</a>
</p>

<p>
  NeWS is a window system and UI/graphics API based on a superset of Adobe's
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a>
  (a stack-based programming language made for printable graphics). NeWS adds interaction support, a UI
  toolkit, cooperative multitasking, and OOP on top of Adobe PostScript and its graphics model.
</p>

<p>
  NeWS was developed in the 1980s at Sun Microsystems and
  originally named "SunDew." (Many of the people behind NeWS ended up building Java.)
  NeWS was ahead of its time --
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.sys.sun.apps/pWR9DUOEC3M/KceDQGHPB2IJ">
    proponents argue it was technically superior to the MIT X Window System that outcompeted it
  </a>
  -- and its design actually resembles the modern Web. (will add more here...)
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kssyt/postscript_vs_pdf/c2n00nt">the words of Don Hopkins</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
  NeWS was architecturally similar to what is now called AJAX, except that NeWS:
  <ul>
    <li>used PostScript code instead of JavaScript for programming.</li>
    <li>used PostScript graphics instead of DHTML/CSS for rendering.</li>
    <li>used PostScript data instead of XML/JSON for data representation.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Aside</h2>

<p>
  Curiously, NeWS got to the same place as the modern Web,
  but took a very different path, decades earlier.
  The argument the NeWS Book makes for the NeWS architecture is basically
  a *compression* argument.
</p>

<p>
  Suppose we have two computers: one is a 'server', where logic runs, and one
  is a 'client' which sits on our desk. How can we build a window system where
  a graphical app runs remotely on the server,
  but we interact with it from our desk?
</p>

<p>
  One approach would be to stream full video of the screen from the server to
  our desk. Steam can do this. But that's bandwidth-intensive and hard to pull off
  if you're back in the 1980s.
</p>

<p>
  Another approach, which is taken (in theory) by the X Window System when you
  do `ssh -X`, is to come up with a basic set of objects, like buttons and
  text boxes, and have the server stream a display list of all the objects to the client.
  If you do this, however, then your objects are frozen in stone and
  might not be what applications want to use -- what if they want to have a custom UI,
  or what if your system button style just looks ugly? -- and if an application
  draws its own stuff, you end up streaming that custom stuff pixel by pixel
  anyway.
</p>

<p>
  NeWS asks: why do we need to send flat lists at all,
  whether of pixels or of higher-level display
  objects? Our client is a full-fledged computer. Why not send a small *program*
  from the server to the client, and let that program draw whatever it wants on the client?
</p>

<p>
  In fact, Adobe built PostScript to solve a very similar problem:
  your Mac could send your LaserWriter printer a compact PostScript program describing the pages to print,
  and the LaserWriter would interpret the program on its own CPU.
  (A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserWriter#Hardware">faster CPU</a>
  than the original Mac's CPU, by the way.)
